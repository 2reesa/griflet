Used functions:
categoryList(message)
|- childList(category) - could be replaced with a nested loop in categoryList?
|- messageLast(map, message)
   |- messageFetch()
   |- resolveDate - needs fixing to DD MMM YYYY format
channelData(message) ?? (lastpost) - non-functional
  does it even serve a purpose now that categoryList works??
    could be repurposed to show all channels' last posts, utilising some of the routines used for categoryList
    or become a 'verbose' mode of categoryList
ping(message)
